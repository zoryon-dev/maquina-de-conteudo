1.  **List files in root** to find config files.
2.  **Read `package.json`** to identify test scripts and dependencies.
3.  **List files in `src/`** recursively to find existing tests (files ending in `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, etc.) and understand the structure better.
4.  **Read a few key files** to understand the coding style and testing patterns (if any tests exist).

Step 1 & 2: Root files and package.json.
